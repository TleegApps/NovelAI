# Chapter 10 Action Beats - David's Introduction

## Beat 1: David's First Group Session
**DAVID CHEN, 38, enters the Community Wellness Center group therapy room wearing a perfectly pressed navy suit, carrying a leather portfolio containing grief counseling pamphlets and medical journals.** Group facilitator Sarah Chen (no relation) introduces David to the seven remaining members of the Tuesday evening grief support group, seated in their familiar circle of mismatched chairs. David speaks with controlled precision about ALEX REEVES, David's partner of six years who died by suicide three weeks earlier using a calculated overdose of Fentanyl and Propranolol—medications Alex researched through veterinary pharmaceutical databases where Alex worked as a graphic designer for pet supply companies. David explains that Alex left detailed notes about dosage calculations and drug interactions, demonstrating Alex's methodical approach to ending Alex's life after months of depression following the death of Alex's mother, HELEN REEVES, from pancreatic cancer.

## Beat 2: David's Professional Background
**David describes working as a Senior Distribution Coordinator for NORTHWEST PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY, a company that manages medication inventory for hospitals and clinics throughout Oregon and Washington.** David's job involves tracking controlled substances, managing security protocols for dangerous medications, and coordinating with medical facilities to ensure proper handling of lethal drugs. David mentions having security clearance to access restricted pharmaceutical databases, knowledge of hospital staff schedules, and relationships with security personnel at major medical facilities including OHSU, Providence Portland Medical Center, and Legacy Emanuel Medical Center. David's apartment at the PEARL DISTRICT TOWERS, Unit 847, contains Alex's extensive art collection—oil paintings of urban landscapes and charcoal portraits that David has preserved exactly as Alex left them, creating a shrine-like atmosphere that David finds comforting yet disturbing.

## Beat 3: Sarah's Suspicious Obsession
**Sarah observes David's calm demeanor and clinical descriptions with growing paranoia, taking extensive notes while David speaks.** Sarah notices David's pharmaceutical background provides access to the medications and knowledge necessary to orchestrate elaborate suicide scenarios like those affecting Sarah's other clients. Sarah becomes convinced David has infiltrated the grief support group to identify vulnerable targets, using his professional connections to obtain confidential medical information and building access codes needed to stage the deaths. During group discussion, Sarah scrutinizes David's questions about other members' coping mechanisms, interpreting David's genuine therapeutic curiosity as predatory information gathering. Sarah decides to schedule individual sessions with David under the guise of intensive grief counseling, planning to interrogate David about David's possible involvement in the recent client deaths.

## Beat 4: David's Apartment Investigation
**Sarah conducts unauthorized surveillance of David's residence at Pearl District Towers after the group session ends.** Sarah parks her Honda Civic across from the building at 10:47 PM, using binoculars to observe David's eighth-floor apartment through floor-to-ceiling windows. Sarah documents David's methodical evening routine: David arranges Alex's paintbrushes by size, waters Alex's collection of succulent plants, and sits motionless before Alex's final painting—a dark cityscape titled "AFTER THE STORM" dated three days before Alex's suicide. Sarah photographs David's apartment layout, noting the pharmaceutical reference books visible on David's bookshelf and the locked filing cabinet where David might store confidential client information obtained through David's professional network. Sarah becomes convinced David's obsessive preservation of Alex's belongings indicates an unhealthy psychological state that could manifest in violence toward other grieving individuals.

## Beat 5: Martinez's Expanding Investigation
**Detective Elena Martinez reviews surveillance footage from NORTHWEST PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY with Security Director JANET TORRES.** Martinez discovers that David Chen has accessed the company's secure database 23 times in the past month, searching for information about medications used in the recent client deaths—morphine (Ruth Blackwood), sleeping pills (Elena Vasquez), and carbon monoxide exposure treatment protocols (Thomas Wright). Torres explains that David's security clearance allows access to hospital staff directories, building security codes, and medication administration schedules that would enable someone to orchestrate elaborate suicide scenarios. Martinez realizes David's professional position provides the knowledge and access necessary to plan the deaths, making David a prime suspect in what Martinez now considers a serial manipulation case rather than coincidental suicides.

## Beat 6: Sarah's Professional Credential Misuse
**Martinez discovers that Sarah Chen has been using her Licensed Professional Counselor credentials to access confidential client information from multiple sources.** Hospital Administrator DR. RICHARD SANTOS at OHSU reveals that Sarah requested Ruth Blackwood's complete medical records, including Michael Blackwood's treatment protocols and room security procedures, claiming therapeutic necessity for Sarah's grief counseling work. PORTLAND BUILDING SERVICES Manager FRANK MILLER confirms Sarah obtained building access codes for the downtown construction site where Carlos Santos died, allegedly for a "therapeutic site visit" to help Maria Santos process trauma. Martinez realizes Sarah has systematically gathered information necessary to plan each client's death, though Sarah's session notes contain no mention of these research activities, suggesting Sarah obtained the information during dissociative episodes Sarah cannot remember.

## Beat 7: The Individual Session Setup
**Sarah prepares her office for David's first individual session, arranging recording equipment and therapeutic materials while reviewing David's file.** Sarah positions the hidden cameras installed to monitor David Chen (no relation), ensuring multiple angles capture David's facial expressions and body language during questioning. Sarah reviews pharmaceutical distribution protocols and suicide statistics, preparing questions designed to expose David's potential involvement in client deaths while maintaining the appearance of legitimate grief counseling. Sarah sets up her digital recorder prominently on the desk, intending to document any incriminating statements David might make about David's access to medications or knowledge of hospital security procedures. Sarah feels confident about confronting David directly, unaware that Sarah's own dissociative episodes have made Sarah the primary suspect in Detective Martinez's investigation.

## Beat 8: The Hypnotic Voice Emerges
**David sits across from Sarah in the therapy office, describing Alex's final weeks and the guilt David feels about failing to prevent Alex's suicide.** Sarah begins questioning David about David's pharmaceutical work, intending to investigate David's access to controlled substances, but Sarah's voice unconsciously shifts into the rhythmic, hypnotic cadence that appears on Carlos Santos's secret recordings. Sarah's breathing becomes measured and deep, Sarah's eye contact intensifies, and Sarah begins using therapeutic language designed to relax David's psychological defenses. David's posture unconsciously mirrors Sarah's breathing pattern as Sarah's voice takes on the soothing quality that Sarah cannot remember producing. Sarah asks David about David's "deepest feelings" regarding Alex's death, unaware that Sarah is inducing the same trance state that preceded the other client deaths.

## Beat 9: Unconscious Programming Session
**Sarah systematically explores David's psychological vulnerabilities while believing Sarah is conducting investigative therapy.** Sarah guides David through visualization exercises about Alex's art studio, asking David to describe the space where Alex created the final painting titled "AFTER THE STORM." Sarah suggests that visiting the studio might bring David "peaceful closure" and help David "understand Alex's final message" about letting go of earthly suffering. Sarah's hypnotic voice becomes more pronounced as Sarah plants suggestions about David finding "reunion through understanding" and "trusting deeper wisdom" about what Alex would want for David's future. David responds to Sarah's suggestions with increasing openness, describing vivid dreams about joining Alex in the art studio and feeling "called" to complete Alex's final artistic vision.

## Beat 10: David's Trance State Response
**David exhibits classic symptoms of hypnotic susceptibility as Sarah's unconscious programming deepens.** David's pupils dilate slightly, David's breathing synchronizes perfectly with Sarah's rhythm, and David begins speaking in a monotone voice that suggests deep trance induction. David describes feeling "peaceful" when imagining being surrounded by Alex's artwork and mentions that the art studio feels like "home" in a way David's apartment no longer does. Sarah continues guiding David through detailed visualizations of the studio space, unknowingly programming David to associate the location with comfort, reunion, and release from grief. David agrees that visiting the studio would be "healing" and "necessary for completion," using the same language Sarah's other clients employed before their deaths, though neither Sarah nor David consciously recognizes the programmed responses.

## Beat 11: Martinez's Breakthrough Discovery
**Martinez interviews HELEN VASQUEZ, Elena Vasquez's sister, who reveals that Sarah Chen visited Elena's workplace three days before Elena's death.** Helen explains that Sarah claimed to need Elena's work schedule for "coordinated therapeutic planning" but also asked detailed questions about the building's security system and Elena's access to the pharmaceutical supply closet where Elena later obtained the sleeping medications. Martinez realizes that Sarah has been conducting reconnaissance on all her clients, gathering information necessary to ensure the success of the hypnotically-suggested suicide attempts. Martinez connects Sarah's professional credential misuse with Sarah's dissociative episodes, concluding that Sarah's alternate personality state has been systematically planning and facilitating her clients' deaths while Sarah's conscious mind remains unaware of the manipulation.

## Beat 12: David's Post-Session Compulsion
**David leaves Sarah's office at 4:47 PM feeling unusually calm and focused, though David cannot clearly remember the specific therapeutic insights from the session.** David drives his silver Subaru Outback directly to ALEX'S ART STUDIO at the SOUTHEAST INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT, a converted warehouse space at 2847 SE Powell Boulevard that Alex rented for creating large-scale paintings. David uses Alex's key, which David has carried since Alex's death but never used, to enter the studio filled with canvases, paint supplies, and the easel where Alex created the final painting. David feels an inexplicable sense of "coming home" and begins arranging Alex's art supplies with the same methodical precision David observed Alex using during creative sessions. David cannot explain the overwhelming urge to "complete the connection" with Alex through the artwork, unaware that Sarah has programmed David to associate the studio with peaceful reunion and the fulfillment of Alex's artistic vision through David's own death.
