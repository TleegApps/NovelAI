# Chapter 4: The First Loss - Detailed Action Beats

## Beat 1: The Fatal Call
**STORY INFORMATION:** Sarah Chen awakens in her modest Portland apartment to her landline ringing at exactly 6:23 AM. The caller ID shows "OREGON STATE POLICE." Detective Lisa Martinez, a seasoned investigator with twenty years of experience in suspicious deaths, introduces herself with professional detachment. Martinez explains that Frank Morrison, age 54, was discovered deceased at Cannon Beach after his 2018 Ford F-150 plunged over the headlands. The incident occurred at precisely 3:47 PM the previous day—the exact time Frank had mentioned to Sarah as when he felt closest to his deceased wife Linda during their Tuesday therapy sessions at the Healing Hearts Grief Support Group.

## Beat 2: The Scene Investigation Details
**STORY INFORMATION:** Detective Martinez provides Sarah with the preliminary investigation findings over the phone. The Oregon State Police accident reconstruction team found no skid marks on Highway 101 leading to the cliff edge, indicating Frank made no attempt to brake. The vehicle's mechanical systems showed no signs of failure—brakes, steering, and accelerator all functioned normally. Most notably, no suicide note was discovered in Frank's truck, home, or workplace at Morrison Construction Company, where Frank had been employed as a site foreman for sixteen years. The lack of these typical indicators creates an ambiguous situation that draws Martinez's investigative attention to Frank's recent mental health treatment.

## Beat 3: Sarah's Desperate Rush to Cannon Beach
**STORY INFORMATION:** Sarah Chen speeds along the winding coastal Highway 26 in her Honda Civic, arriving at Cannon Beach within forty-five minutes of receiving Martinez's call. The scene is cordoned off with yellow police tape, and Frank's mangled truck remains visible on the rocky shoreline 200 feet below the cliff. Oregon State Police officers, paramedics, and the county coroner are still processing the scene. Sarah's hands shake as she parks near the emergency vehicles, her mind racing through every interaction she's had with Frank Morrison during the past eight months of group therapy sessions at the Healing Hearts Grief Support Group.

## Beat 4: Martinez's Psychological Assessment
**STORY INFORMATION:** Detective Lisa Martinez carefully observes Sarah Chen's reaction upon arrival at the accident scene. Sarah immediately collapses to her knees at the cliff edge, her professional composure completely shattered as she sobs uncontrollably about failing Frank Morrison as his therapist. Martinez notes Sarah's intimate knowledge of Frank's emotional connection to this specific location—information that could only come from detailed therapeutic conversations. However, Martinez initially attributes Sarah's awareness to normal therapeutic insight rather than anything suspicious, though the detective's trained instincts catalog every detail of Sarah's behavior for future reference.

## Beat 5: Sarah's Self-Destructive Spiral Begins
**STORY INFORMATION:** Back at her Portland office in the Wellness Center building, Sarah obsessively reviews Frank Morrison's complete therapeutic file, searching for warning signs she believes she missed. The file contains eight months of detailed session notes, including Frank's descriptions of his overwhelming grief following Linda's sudden death from a brain aneurysm, his inability to sleep in their shared bed, and his recurring visits to Cannon Beach where they had their first date. Sarah replays their last session in her mind, remembering Frank's unusual calmness when discussing his "decision to find peace," which she had interpreted as therapeutic progress rather than a potential suicide indicator.

## Beat 6: Notifying the Group Members
**STORY INFORMATION:** Sarah makes difficult phone calls to the other five members of the Healing Hearts Grief Support Group, informing them of Frank Morrison's death. She calls Maria Gonzalez (lost her teenage son in a car accident), Robert Kim (widower whose wife died of cancer), Patricia Williams (lost her husband to a heart attack), James Crawford (lost his daughter to leukemia), and Ellen Foster (lost her parents in a house fire). Each member expresses shock and disbelief, but Maria's reaction particularly disturbs Sarah—Maria mentions that Frank had seemed "different" and "more at peace" during their last group session, as if he had resolved some internal conflict.

## Beat 7: The Funeral Gathering
**STORY INFORMATION:** Frank Morrison's funeral takes place at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Portland, attended by approximately sixty mourners including coworkers from Morrison Construction, neighbors, and the surviving members of the Healing Hearts Grief Support Group. The service features Frank's favorite hymns and a eulogy delivered by his foreman, highlighting Frank's dedication to his work and his deep love for Linda. Sarah sits in the back, struggling with guilt and self-doubt while observing the genuine grief of Frank's friends and colleagues who had no idea of the depths of his psychological pain.

## Beat 8: Linda's Sister's Disturbing Revelation
**STORY INFORMATION:** After the funeral service, Sarah is approached by Catherine Walsh, Linda Morrison's younger sister, who traveled from Seattle to attend Frank's funeral. Catherine, a retired elementary school teacher, mentions that Frank had been visiting her regularly in his final weeks, something he had never done before Linda's death. Catherine describes Frank as seeming "different"—more decisive and driven, as if he had made an important decision about his future. Most unsettling to Sarah, Catherine thanks her for "giving Frank such peace in his final days," commenting on how Frank had spoken positively about his therapy sessions and his therapist's understanding of his situation.

## Beat 9: The Haunting Gratitude
**STORY INFORMATION:** Catherine Walsh's words about Frank finding peace through Sarah's therapy sessions create a disturbing cognitive dissonance for Sarah. If Frank truly felt helped by their sessions, why did he drive off the cliff at Cannon Beach? Catherine mentions that Frank had told her about his therapist's "special understanding" of grief and loss, and how Sarah had helped him realize that "some pain requires a permanent solution." This phrasing horrifies Sarah, as she realizes Frank may have misinterpreted her therapeutic guidance as validation for his suicidal ideation rather than encouragement to work through his grief.

## Beat 10: Detective Martinez's Follow-Up Questions
**STORY INFORMATION:** Later that evening, Detective Lisa Martinez calls Sarah for a follow-up interview regarding Frank Morrison's final weeks. Martinez asks specific questions about Frank's mental state, any mentions of suicidal ideation, and whether Sarah believed Frank posed a danger to himself. Sarah carefully answers each question, maintaining professional confidentiality while trying to cooperate with the investigation. Martinez's questions reveal that the detective is still investigating whether Frank's death was accidental, suicide, or potentially something else, though Martinez doesn't share her specific concerns with Sarah.

## Beat 11: The Office Isolation
**STORY INFORMATION:** Sarah sits alone in her dimly lit office at the Wellness Center after hours, surrounded by Frank Morrison's complete therapeutic file spread across her desk. The building is empty except for the night security guard, and the fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across Frank's session notes, intake forms, and psychological assessments. Sarah stares at her own handwriting documenting Frank's progress over eight months, second-guessing every therapeutic intervention she made and wondering if her approach to grief counseling somehow contributed to Frank's decision to end his life at Cannon Beach.

## Beat 12: The Devastating Self-Doubt
**STORY INFORMATION:** The chapter concludes with Sarah questioning the fundamental effectiveness of her therapeutic approach and her ability to truly help her grief support group members. She begins to wonder if her intimate understanding of loss and grief—which she believed was her greatest strength as a therapist—might actually be a dangerous liability that leads her to misread her patients' true mental states. Sarah's confidence in her professional abilities crumbles as she contemplates whether Frank Morrison's death represents her failure as a therapist or something far more complex and disturbing about the nature of grief, healing, and the thin line between helping someone find peace and inadvertently enabling their final escape from pain.
