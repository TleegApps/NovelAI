# Chapter Action Beats - Ruth Blackwood's Death

## Beat 1: The Security Breach Discovery
**FADE IN on OHSU Hospital's security office at dawn.** Security Chief FRANK TORRES reviews overnight footage on multiple monitors, coffee growing cold beside surveillance logs. Torres freezes the feed at 11:47 PM, rewinding to watch RUTH BLACKWOOD, 58, silver-haired and wearing scrubs that don't quite fit, swipe a keycard at the staff entrance. The card reader flashes green. Torres cross-references the card number with the personnel database, discovering it belongs to JENNIFER WALSH, a former oncology nurse who quit four months ago after a patient complaint. The keycard should have been deactivated immediately upon Walsh's departure per hospital protocol.

## Beat 2: Ruth's Methodical Journey
**Security footage montage shows Ruth's progression through the hospital.** Ruth moves with unnatural confidence through corridors she's never walked, checking room numbers against a handwritten note. She approaches three separate security checkpoints, each time using different keycards she somehow possesses. At the secured oncology wing entrance, Ruth pauses before Door 237B—the elevator to the restricted ward—and produces a master access card typically reserved for department heads. The timestamp shows 12:23 AM as Ruth disappears into the elevator, heading directly to the seventh floor where her son MICHAEL BLACKWOOD spent his final weeks.

## Beat 3: The Perfect Recreation
**Inside Room 712, Ruth works with surgical precision.** Ruth has somehow acquired Michael's exact medical chart, spread across the bedside table alongside vials of morphine and saline solution. Ruth methodically recreates the IV setup that delivered Michael's pain medication during his final days, using identical tubing, flow regulators, and even the same brand of IV bag holder. Ruth measures morphine doses with a precision scale, calculating dosages that would require advanced pharmaceutical knowledge. The room's atmosphere is almost ritualistic as Ruth arranges everything exactly as it was during Michael's treatment, down to positioning the bed at the same angle and adjusting the lighting to match the warm glow Michael preferred during his final nights.

## Beat 4: The Peaceful Departure
**Ruth's final moments unfold in real-time.** Ruth changes into one of Michael's hospital gowns, carefully folded in the room's closet as if preserved for this moment. Ruth lies in the exact position where Michael died six months earlier, inserting the IV needle with practiced skill. Ruth activates the morphine drip, closes her eyes, and places her hands in the same prayer position witnesses described seeing Michael use. The security camera captures Ruth's face transforming from grief-stricken determination to profound serenity, her breathing gradually slowing as the morphine takes effect. The timestamp reads 2:47 AM when Ruth's chest rises and falls for the final time.

## Beat 5: The Morning Discovery
**Day shift nurse PATRICIA VALDEZ enters Room 712 at 7:15 AM for routine rounds.** Valdez expects to find the room empty and ready for cleaning, but instead discovers Ruth's body lying peacefully in Michael's former bed. Valdez immediately calls for Dr. RICHARD SANTOS, the oncology ward supervisor, who arrives within minutes to confirm Ruth's death. Santos notices the sophisticated IV setup and recognizes it as identical to the pain management protocol used for Michael Blackwood months earlier. Hospital security seals the room while Valdez contacts the Portland Police Bureau, specifically requesting Detective MARTINEZ due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding recent deaths in the grief counseling community.

## Beat 6: Martinez's Investigation Begins
**Detective ELENA MARTINEZ arrives at OHSU Hospital with forensics team CHEN and RODRIGUEZ.** Martinez examines the security footage with Torres, noting Ruth's impossible knowledge of hospital layout and security protocols. Medical Examiner DR. LISA PARK confirms the morphine overdose was administered with medical precision, requiring knowledge of proper dosage calculations and IV flow rates. Martinez discovers Ruth's purse contains detailed floor plans of the oncology ward, security card access codes written on index cards, and a photograph of Michael in his hospital bed taken during his final week. The evidence suggests Ruth had inside help or possessed knowledge she couldn't have obtained independently.

## Beat 7: The Pattern Emerges
**Martinez spreads case files across the conference room at Portland Police Bureau.** Martinez reviews the deaths of THOMAS WRIGHT (carbon monoxide in garage), ELENA VASQUEZ (overdose of sleeping pills), and now Ruth Blackwood (morphine overdose), noting each death mirrors specific fears or wishes the victims expressed in grief counseling sessions. Martinez cross-references the victims' therapy records with session notes from DR. SARAH CHEN's support group, discovering all three attended the same weekly meetings at the Community Wellness Center. Martinez circles dates on a calendar, realizing each death occurred within 72 hours of a group therapy session where the victim discussed their specific method of coping with loss.

## Beat 8: Formal Questioning Setup
**Martinez contacts Sarah Chen to arrange formal questioning at the police station.** Martinez reviews Sarah's credentials, discovering Sarah's background in hypnotherapy and her recent certification in grief counseling following her daughter EMMA's death in a car accident eight months earlier. Martinez prepares detailed questions about each deceased client, focusing on Sarah's therapeutic methods and the timing of the deaths relative to Emma's accident. Martinez instructs Officer JACKSON to set up the interview room with recording equipment, ensuring everything is documented as the investigation moves from suspicious coincidence to potential criminal inquiry.

## Beat 9: Sarah's Interrogation
**Sarah sits across from Martinez in Interview Room B at Portland Police Bureau.** Martinez questions Sarah about her therapy sessions, specifically asking about Thomas Wright's obsession with his garage, Elena Vasquez's collection of sleeping medications, and Ruth Blackwood's detailed knowledge of her son's medical treatment. Sarah provides cooperative but increasingly distressed answers, claiming she followed standard grief counseling protocols and maintained appropriate client confidentiality. Martinez notices Sarah's responses become vague when asked about specific session details, with Sarah claiming she doesn't clearly remember individual conversations due to the emotional intensity of her work and her own grief over Emma's death.

## Beat 10: Sarah's Growing Paranoia
**Sarah returns to her office at the Community Wellness Center, visibly shaken by the police questioning.** Sarah retrieves client files from her locked cabinet, spreading them across her desk in obsessive detail. Sarah creates a timeline on her whiteboard, mapping each client's attendance against the dates of their deaths, looking for patterns she might have missed. Sarah examines the group roster, focusing on newer members who joined after Emma's death, particularly DAVID CHEN, a quiet man in his 40s who mentioned working in pharmaceutical distribution during his first session. Sarah becomes convinced David possesses the knowledge and access necessary to orchestrate the elaborate deaths, seeing him as a predator who infiltrated her group to identify vulnerable targets.

## Beat 11: David Chen Investigation
**Sarah conducts covert research on David Chen using her office computer.** Sarah discovers David works for PACIFIC MEDICAL SUPPLY, a company with contracts to hospitals throughout Oregon, including OHSU where Ruth died. Sarah finds David's employee ID gives him access to medical facilities, explaining how Ruth could have obtained hospital keycards and medical equipment. Sarah reviews her session notes, finding David asked specific questions about other members' coping mechanisms and showed unusual interest in their personal details. Sarah becomes convinced David is manipulating vulnerable group members, using information from therapy sessions to stage elaborate suicides that fulfill each victim's darkest fantasies about joining their deceased loved ones.

## Beat 12: The Surveillance Setup
**Sarah installs hidden cameras throughout her office after hours, working alone in the darkened Community Wellness Center.** Sarah positions tiny wireless cameras behind books, inside picture frames, and within decorative plants, ensuring every angle of the therapy circle is covered. Sarah tests the recording equipment on her laptop, reviewing camera angles and audio quality to ensure she captures every interaction during upcoming group sessions. Sarah places motion-activated recorders inside her desk drawers and filing cabinets, determined to catch David accessing confidential client information. Sarah locks her office and heads home, convinced she's taking the first step toward protecting her remaining clients while gathering evidence to prove David Chen is the killer systematically destroying her grief support group.
