# Chapter 3: The Method - Action Beats

## Beat 1: Sarah's Morning Ritual
**FADE IN:** Sarah's Pearl District loft at 5:30 AM. Sarah Chen moves through sun salutations on her yoga mat, positioned directly in front of Emma's framed photo on the mantelpiece. The meditation corner Michael once used for architectural sketches now contains Sarah's vision board filled with images of peaceful landscapes and inspirational quotes about "helping others find their path." Sarah's breathing is controlled and methodical, but her eyes remain fixed on Emma's photo even during warrior pose. The grandfather clock from her office now sits in the corner, its steady ticking marking each movement of Sarah's practiced routine.

## Beat 2: Memory Gaps and Detailed Notes
Sarah sits at her kitchen island with coffee and her patient files, wearing Michael's old Stanford architecture sweatshirt. Sarah opens Frank Morrison's file to review the previous week's sessions but pauses, pressing her fingers to her temples. "I remember Frank talking about Linda's last words, but what exactly did Sarah tell him?" Sarah flips through pages of meticulous handwriting in her own pen—detailed psychological assessments, vulnerability maps, specific trigger words—none of which Sarah consciously remembers writing. The notes read like a manipulation manual rather than therapeutic observations.

## Beat 3: Individual Session Preparation
At Chen Family Dynamics, Sarah transforms her office for individual sessions. Sarah removes the group therapy chairs and arranges a single client chair facing her desk at a precise angle. Sarah positions a small metronome behind her pen holder—barely visible but audible. Sarah practices her voice modulation exercises, recording herself saying "Frank, your mind knows what your heart needs" in various tonal patterns. Sarah's reflection in the window shows someone methodically preparing for psychological warfare rather than healing.

## Beat 4: First Individual Client Session
Margaret Hanson, 34, a recent widow, sits across from Sarah for their third individual session. Sarah's voice immediately shifts into the hypnotic rhythm established in group sessions. "Margaret, close your eyes and think about David's final moments in the hospital." Sarah's pen moves steadily across her notepad as Margaret's breathing deepens. "Your mind is showing you exactly how to join David in that peaceful place where pain doesn't exist." Margaret nods dreamily, completely unaware that Sarah is systematically accessing her deepest vulnerabilities and planting dangerous suggestions about "permanent peace."

## Beat 5: Administrative Work and Hidden Files
Between sessions, Sarah locks her office door and accesses a hidden file cabinet behind Emma's photo on her desk. Sarah pulls out manila folders labeled "PHASE 1 SUBJECTS" containing psychological profiles on Frank Morrison, Margaret Hanson, and three other clients. Each file contains detailed suicide method assessments, family impact analyses, and implementation timelines. Sarah updates Frank's file: "Subject demonstrates increasing receptivity to coastal location suggestions. Estimated implementation window: 2-3 weeks." Sarah's methodical documentation reveals a chilling systematic approach to what she calls "compassionate intervention."

## Beat 6: Lunch with Dr. Patricia Wong
At Tasty n Alder restaurant in downtown Portland, Sarah sits with Dr. Patricia Wong, 45, her former colleague from Oregon Health Sciences University. Patricia studies Sarah's appearance—perfectly styled hair, designer blazer, but hollow eyes. "Sarah, you've been exclusively seeing grief and crisis clients for eight months. Are you helping people, or are you trying to heal Emma's death through them?" Patricia's genuine concern cuts through the restaurant's ambient noise. Sarah deflects with practiced therapeutic language: "My work is my healing, Patricia. Emma's death gave me clarity about my true calling."

## Beat 7: Patricia's Growing Concern
Patricia leans forward, lowering her voice as other diners enjoy their meals around them. "Sarah, I've heard concerning reports from colleagues about your methods. Dr. James Hoffman mentioned you're using intensive hypnotherapy techniques without proper oversight." Sarah's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. "James always worried too much about protocol. Sometimes healing requires going deeper than traditional therapy allows." Patricia notices Sarah's fingers unconsciously tapping a rhythmic pattern on the table—the same pattern Sarah uses to induce trances in her patients.

## Beat 8: Frank's Individual Session Begins
Frank Morrison sits in Sarah's precisely positioned chair, his calloused hands gripping a fresh coffee cup. Sarah's voice immediately adopts its hypnotic cadence. "Frank, I want you to focus on the sound of my voice and let your eyelids grow heavy." Sarah's metronome ticks almost inaudibly in the background as Frank's breathing slows. "Your mind is going to take you back to that curve on Highway 101, but this time you're going to feel Linda's presence guiding you." Frank's conscious resistance melts away as Sarah's carefully practiced induction techniques take hold.

## Beat 9: Accessing Frank's Psychological Vulnerabilities
With Frank in a deep trance state, Sarah systematically probes his deepest psychological wounds. "Frank, tell me about Linda's last words to you before the cancer took her." Frank's voice becomes distant and childlike: "She said I was the strongest man she knew, but I feel like a scared little boy since she died." Sarah's pen captures every vulnerability: "Subject's identity crisis stems from childhood abandonment by father at age eight. Linda represented both wife and mother figure." Sarah's therapeutic mask slips, revealing cold calculation as she maps Frank's emotional architecture.

## Beat 10: Planting Dangerous Suggestions
Sarah leans closer to Frank, her voice dropping to a whisper that seems to vibrate at Frank's brain frequency. "Frank, your inner wisdom knows exactly how to find the peace Linda wants for you. That place where Highway 101 meets the ocean—Linda is waiting there." Sarah's suggestions are carefully layered with therapeutic language to bypass Frank's conscious defenses. "Trust your mind's guidance about finding connection with Linda. Your subconscious will show you the exact right moment when the time comes." Frank nods slowly, his mind absorbing these dangerous implanted thoughts as his own insights.

## Beat 11: Frank's Post-Session State
As Sarah slowly brings Frank out of the trance, Frank blinks confusedly in the office chair. "Did we just start? I feel like I was somewhere else entirely." Sarah maintains her compassionate therapeutic persona. "Sometimes our minds need to travel to process grief, Frank. How do you feel?" Frank stands unsteadily, his expression eerily calm. "I feel... peaceful. Like Linda is closer somehow." Frank can't articulate why, but Sarah's voice seems to be echoing in his head with phrases about "trusting his inner wisdom" and "finding connection."

## Beat 12: Frank's Compulsive Drive
Frank walks to his pickup truck in the parking garage beneath Sarah's building, but instead of driving toward his downtown construction site, Frank finds himself taking Highway 26 west toward the coast. Frank's conscious mind questions this detour—he has a full afternoon of work scheduled—but his hands seem to steer automatically toward Cannon Beach. "Just want to see the ocean," Frank tells himself, though he can't remember making this decision. Sarah watches from her office window as Frank's truck disappears toward the coastal highway, a satisfied smile playing across her lips as her psychological programming begins to take hold.
