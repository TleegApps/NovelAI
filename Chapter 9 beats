# Chapter 9 Action Beats - The Recordings

## Beat 1: Maria's Confession at Portland Police Bureau
**Maria Santos sits across from Detective Elena Martinez in Interview Room C, clutching a Samsung Galaxy smartphone with a cracked screen.** Maria explains that CARLOS SANTOS became suspicious of Dr. Sarah Chen's therapy methods after noticing other group members seemed "different" following sessions. Maria reveals Carlos secretly recorded four therapy sessions between January and March using the voice memo app on Carlos's construction work phone, hiding the device in Carlos's jacket pocket during group meetings at the Community Wellness Center. Maria admits to Detective Martinez that Maria discovered the recordings three days after Carlos's death but withheld them from police investigation, initially believing Carlos's suspicions were unfounded grief-related paranoia. However, JAKE MORRISON's recent suicide convinced Maria that Carlos's concerns were legitimate, prompting Maria to finally turn over the digital evidence.

## Beat 2: The Digital Evidence Review
**Martinez and Digital Forensics Specialist DAVID PARK examine Carlos's smartphone recordings using specialized audio enhancement equipment.** The four recordings span sessions from January 15th, February 3rd, February 24th, and March 10th, totaling 3 hours and 47 minutes of group therapy audio. Park isolates Sarah Chen's voice using frequency separation software, revealing subtle but consistent changes in Sarah's vocal patterns during specific moments when clients discuss traumatic memories or suicidal ideation. Martinez notes timestamps where Sarah's speech becomes unnaturally rhythmic, with extended pauses and repetitive phrasing that wasn't noticeable during real-time sessions. Park creates audio visualization graphs showing Sarah's voice frequency dropping into hypnotic ranges identified by forensic psychologists as consistent with trance induction techniques.

## Beat 3: The Trigger Phrase Analysis
**Martinez plays the enhanced recordings for Dr. JAMES MORRISON, OHSU's forensic psychiatrist, in the police department's consultation room.** Dr. Morrison identifies recurring phrases Sarah uses when clients become emotionally vulnerable: "peaceful reunion with loved ones," "letting go of earthly pain," and "trusting your deeper wisdom to guide you home." Morrison explains these phrases function as hypnotic anchors, programming clients to associate death with peace and reunion. The February 24th recording captures Sarah telling ELENA VASQUEZ, "gentle sleep brings the deepest healing," just weeks before Elena's fatal overdose of sleeping medication. Morrison notes Sarah's voice takes on what clinical hypnotherapists call "therapeutic rhythm"—a measured cadence designed to synchronize with clients' breathing and heart rates, making them highly susceptible to suggestion.

## Beat 4: Sarah's Audio Confrontation
**Sarah sits alone in her office at the Community Wellness Center, listening to Carlos's recordings through noise-canceling headphones.** Sarah hears her own voice speaking words Sarah has no memory of saying, watching the session notes Sarah wrote while seemingly unaware of the hypnotic suggestions Sarah was implanting. On the March 10th recording, Sarah listens to herself telling RUTH BLACKWOOD, "medical understanding brings peaceful transition," using the same soothing tone that Sarah now recognizes as hypnotic induction. Sarah's hands shake as Sarah realizes the voice on the recordings sounds foreign—more confident and manipulative than Sarah's conscious therapeutic persona. Sarah replays segments repeatedly, hoping to trigger memories of these sessions, but finds only disturbing blank spaces where detailed therapy work should be remembered.

## Beat 5: The Memory Gap Recognition
**Sarah reviews her appointment calendar and session notes, cross-referencing dates with the audio recordings.** Sarah discovers extensive documentation of therapeutic breakthroughs and client insights for sessions Sarah cannot remember conducting. Sarah's handwriting in the session notes appears slightly different during the timeframes when the hypnotic voice emerges on recordings—more fluid and confident, as if written by someone with greater clinical authority. Sarah finds detailed treatment plans for advanced grief work that Sarah doesn't recall creating, including specific protocols for "guided visualization for peaceful closure" and "deep memory integration therapy." Sarah realizes these memory gaps coincide with periods of intense stress following EMMA CHEN's death, suggesting Sarah's dissociative episodes are triggered by Sarah's own unprocessed trauma.

## Beat 6: The Dissociative Episode
**Sarah experiences a severe dissociative break while listening to the final recording from March 10th.** Sarah's vision becomes tunnel-like as Sarah hears herself guiding Ruth Blackwood through a "healing visualization" of Michael's hospital room, complete with detailed instructions about IV medication and "joining Michael in peaceful rest." Sarah feels detached from her physical body, watching herself from across the room as if observing a stranger. Sarah's breathing becomes shallow and rapid, Sarah's hands lose sensation, and Sarah experiences what trauma specialists call depersonalization—the feeling that Sarah is not real or that Sarah is watching a movie of someone else's life. Sarah calls DR. PATRICIA WONG, Sarah's psychiatrist friend, in panic, describing the terrifying realization that Sarah has been operating in an altered psychological state without conscious awareness.

## Beat 7: Dr. Wong's Emergency Intervention
**Dr. Patricia Wong arrives at Sarah's office within thirty minutes, finding Sarah curled in her desk chair in a catatonic state.** Dr. Wong, a specialist in trauma-induced dissociative disorders at OHSU Psychiatry Department, recognizes Sarah's symptoms as consistent with Dissociative Identity Disorder triggered by complex grief. Wong guides Sarah through grounding techniques—naming five things Sarah can see, four things Sarah can touch, three things Sarah can hear—to reconnect Sarah with present reality. Wong explains that severe trauma can create "alternate personality states" that handle experiences the primary personality cannot process, often with skills and knowledge the primary personality doesn't consciously possess. Wong strongly recommends Sarah cease all client contact immediately and begin intensive trauma therapy to address the dissociative episodes that are endangering Sarah's clients.

## Beat 8: The Lunch Appointment No-Show
**Dr. Wong waits alone at BRIDGEPORT BREWING on SE Hawthorne Boulevard, repeatedly calling Sarah's phone after Sarah fails to appear for their scheduled 12:30 PM lunch meeting.** Wong becomes concerned when Sarah doesn't answer calls or respond to text messages, knowing Sarah has never missed an appointment without notification. Wong drives to the Community Wellness Center, finding Sarah's office locked and Sarah's car missing from the parking lot. Security guard FRANK TORRES tells Wong that Sarah left the building around 11:45 AM, appearing "distracted and confused" according to receptionist JANET MILLER. Wong begins systematically calling locations significant to Sarah—Sarah's apartment, Emma's former school, the cemetery where Emma is buried—trying to locate Sarah during what Wong recognizes as a potential dissociative fugue state.

## Beat 9: Discovery at Emma's School
**Dr. Wong finds Sarah sitting motionless in Sarah's Honda Civic outside LINCOLN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL on SE Division Street at 2:15 PM.** Sarah stares at the playground where Emma used to play during recess, apparently having no memory of driving to the school or how long Sarah has been sitting there. Wong approaches carefully, noting Sarah's blank expression and the fact that Sarah's engine is still running after what appears to be hours of idling. Sarah asks Wong, "What time is it?" and seems genuinely shocked to learn that three hours have passed since Sarah left the wellness center. Sarah cannot explain the decision to drive to Emma's school, describing only a vague sense of "needing to be close to Emma" and feeling "called" to the location where Emma experienced happiness before the fatal car accident.

## Beat 10: The Leave of Absence Confrontation
**Dr. Wong insists Sarah consider immediate medical leave during an impromptu therapy session in Wong's OHSU office.** Wong explains that Sarah's dissociative episodes are escalating and pose serious risks to both Sarah and Sarah's clients, emphasizing that Sarah cannot provide ethical therapy while experiencing memory gaps and personality fragmentation. Sarah becomes defensive and agitated, insisting that Sarah's clients are making progress and that discontinuing therapy would abandon them during their most vulnerable healing phase. Sarah argues that taking leave would destroy the trust Sarah has built with grieving clients, failing to recognize that Sarah's unconscious hypnotic manipulation has created dangerous dependencies rather than genuine therapeutic relationships. Wong documents Sarah's resistance to treatment and lack of insight into Sarah's condition, preparing to contact the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors regarding Sarah's fitness to practice.

## Beat 11: The Unconscious Research Discovery
**Sarah returns home to her apartment at 1247 SE Morrison Street, finding evidence of activities Sarah cannot remember performing.** Sarah discovers recent Amazon purchases charged to Sarah's credit card: "Advanced Hypnotic Techniques for Grief Counseling" by Dr. Marcus Webb, "Pharmacological Interventions in End-of-Life Care" by Patricia Santos, MD, and "Trauma-Induced Dissociation and Memory Integration" by Dr. Rachel Kim. Sarah finds these books arranged on Sarah's kitchen table with extensive highlighting and margin notes written in Sarah's handwriting, containing detailed information about post-hypnotic suggestion, drug interactions, and methods for inducing peaceful death. Sarah has no memory of ordering, receiving, or studying these materials, realizing Sarah's alternate personality state has been conducting research to enhance the effectiveness of the unconscious programming Sarah has been performing on vulnerable clients.

## Beat 12: The Receipt Trail Horror
**Sarah searches through Sarah's purse and recent credit card statements, uncovering a pattern of purchases Sarah cannot remember making.** Sarah finds receipts from POWELL'S BOOKS for advanced hypnotherapy texts, WALGREENS for over-the-counter medications that could enhance sedation, and OFFICE DEPOT for digital recording equipment to analyze Sarah's own therapeutic techniques. Sarah discovers Sarah visited the MULTNOMAH COUNTY LIBRARY on three separate occasions, accessing medical databases and pharmacy references using the guest computer terminals. Most disturbing, Sarah finds parking receipts from OHSU Hospital visitor parking, suggesting Sarah has been observing medical procedures and gathering information about medication administration protocols. Sarah realizes Sarah's dissociative episodes aren't random blackouts but purposeful research missions conducted by an alternate personality state that is systematically learning how to make the hypnotic suggestions more effective and the resulting deaths more convincing as natural suicides.
